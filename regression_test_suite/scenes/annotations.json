    "motion_blur_dupli_instances": "Blender has some internal problems synchronizing its dependency graph in this particular case which results in geometry being altered every time a frame is changed. This problem gets even more evident when Blender is run in headless mode (used in the test suite). In this particular case, motion blur works in Blender 2.93.6. It seems that the problem lies in bpy.types.RenderEngine.frame_set(frame, subframe)",
